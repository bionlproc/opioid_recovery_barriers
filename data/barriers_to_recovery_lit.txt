Low self-confidence and negative self-perception: A deeply ingrained negative self-image can significantly increase the risk of relapse by fostering feelings of worthlessness, making it difficult to build healthy relationships, and deterring individuals from seeking help. This negative self-perception also contributes to poor self-care and reinforces internalized stigma, making the recovery process more challenging.

Fear of dealing with emotions and anxiety: Opioids often mask underlying emotional issues and boost self-esteem, creating a fear of confronting raw emotions without the crutch of drugs. This fear makes it difficult for individuals to manage overwhelming feelings of anxiety, worry, and stress, which can hinder the recovery process and increase vulnerability to relapse.

Fear of stigma: Stigma related to aging, past drug use, mental health issues, poverty, and methadone treatment profoundly affects self-identity and recovery. The internalization of these stigmas can lead to shame, social withdrawal, and a reluctance to seek or continue treatment, further complicating the recovery journey.

Negative attitudes or beliefs about treatment: Stigmatizing beliefs about medication-assisted treatment (MAT) and the uncertainties surrounding treatment options can prevent individuals from seeking help. Misinformation, fear of judgment, and negative perceptions of treatment can lead to resistance or disengagement from the recovery process.

Unsuitable/ineffective services and exclusionary attitudes, policies, and programs: Inadequate or rigid treatment services, particularly for those with co-occurring mental health conditions, fail to meet the specific needs of individuals. Exclusionary policies, such as restrictive program hours, lack of language services, and daily attendance requirements, further alienate those seeking help, limiting their access to effective treatment.

Housing instability and homelessness: A lack of stable housing creates an unpredictable and stressful environment that disrupts recovery efforts. Without a secure place to live, access to treatment is often compromised, and the constant exposure to triggers increases the risk of relapse.

Difficulties with establishing a non-drug using network of friends and lack of social capital or support: Building new, supportive social networks that do not involve drug use is a significant challenge. The absence of compassionate and understanding relationships, particularly with family members, can lead to isolation and a lack of the social support necessary for successful recovery.

Over-reliance on other patients or treatment staff in treatment facilities: In treatment centers, individuals may become overly dependent on other patients and staff, creating a sense of being caught between two worlds. This reliance can hinder the development of personal autonomy and coping skills essential for long-term recovery.

Influence of habits of spouse/partner/family members/peers to drugs: The drug use habits of close family members, partners, or friends can increase the availability and temptation of drugs, making it harder for individuals to maintain sobriety. This close proximity to drug use can be a significant trigger for relapse.

Secrecy or fear about the past in new interpersonal relations: The inability to share past experiences with new acquaintances can lead to feelings of isolation and exile from mainstream society. This secrecy can create barriers to forming genuine, supportive relationships, which are crucial for recovery.

Fear of incarceration: For some individuals, particularly women who fear losing custody of their children, the threat of incarceration is a significant barrier. The criminalization of drug use, fear of police harassment, and the risk of arrest discourage seeking help, leading to untreated addiction and increased relapse risk.

Co-morbid mental and physical health issues: The presence of additional addictions or physical and mental health conditions, such as anxiety, depression, self-loathing, childhood trauma, or physical illnesses, complicates the recovery process. These co-occurring issues require specialized treatment, and when unaddressed, they can significantly hinder recovery.

Expensive costs and financial problems: The high costs of treatment, particularly for those without insurance, can prevent individuals from accessing necessary care. Financial barriers, including the inability to afford medication and out-of-pocket costs, are significant obstacles to sustained recovery.

Issues in accessing treatment: Accessing treatment is particularly challenging for individuals from culturally and linguistically diverse communities or those in rural areas. Geographical barriers, lack of transportation, and limited availability of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) create significant obstacles to regular and consistent treatment.

Identity difficulties: Some individuals struggle with the identity transformation required by treatment programs, resisting the label of ‘patient’ and finding it difficult to construct a new identity free from drug use. This identity conflict can create resistance to treatment and complicate the recovery process.

Staff attitudes and training deficiencies: Judgmental attitudes from treatment providers and staff who lack empathy and understanding can create an unwelcoming environment for patients. When staff view clients as psychologically impaired or needing long-term maintenance without offering hope for recovery, it can discourage individuals from engaging fully in treatment.

Lack of connection between emergency care and professional medical treatment: A disconnect between emergency care services and ongoing professional medical treatment can lead to gaps in care. This lack of continuity can result in missed opportunities for intervention and support, increasing the risk of relapse.

Lack of adherence to treatment protocol: Managing multiple appointments and responsibilities, especially for mothers, can be overwhelming and lead to non-adherence to treatment protocols. The stress of balancing treatment with daily life can make it difficult to stay committed to recovery.

Misuse of prescribed medications: Some individuals misuse their prescribed medications by taking higher doses than recommended or combining them with illicit substances. This misuse can undermine the effectiveness of treatment and increase the risk of relapse.

Belief that treatment was unnecessary: Some individuals prefer to withdraw from opioids alone, without assistance, believing that treatment is unnecessary. This belief can lead to unsuccessful attempts at recovery and a higher likelihood of relapse.

Fear of withdrawal symptoms: The physical and psychological symptoms of withdrawal, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle aches, sweating, chills, fever, anxiety, depression, and intense cravings, can be overwhelming. The fear of experiencing these symptoms often discourages individuals from seeking help or continuing with treatment, increasing the risk of relapse.
